# 
#   * Find your favorite sensor on https://waqi.info/ 
#   * The sensor should have a URL in one of the two following forms: 
# 
#   `https://aqicn.org/station/<CITY OR COUNTRY NAME>/<STREET>`
#   or
# 
#   `https://aqicn.org/station/@36655//`
#   or 
#   
#   `https://aqicn.org/city/<CITY OR COUNTRY NAME>/<STREET>`
# 
# With your URL, we will need to do two things:
# 
#  * download the historical air quality readings as a CSV file
#  * note down the URL for the real-time API (you will need to create an API key for accessing this).
# 
# If your sensor's URL has one of the first two formats (the first URL path component is `station`), you will find the links to both historical CSV data and the real-time API on the same web page.
# 
# However, if your sensor's URL has the last format above (the first URL path component is `city` instead of `station`), then you will need to use 2 different URLs - one to download the historical CSV data and one for the real-time air quality measurements. You will find both of those links in the "Air quality historical data" section. Click on the "Historical air quality data" when you need to download the CSV file, and when you need the real-time API, click on the "Real-time air quality data".
# 
# Some examples of URLs for stations:
# 
#  * https://aqicn.org/station/sweden/stockholm-hornsgatan-108-gata/ - in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * https://aqicn.org/station/@36655// - in Hell's Kitchen, Manhatten, New York, USA
#  * https://aqicn.org/station/nigeria-benin-city-edo-state-secretariat-palm-house/ - in Benin City, Nigeria
#  * https://aqicn.org/station/india/mumbai/sion/ - Sion in Mumbai, India
# 
# Here is what the webpage at URL for the Stockholm sensor looks like:
# 
# ![station.png](attachment:1922302e-13b9-469d-ba75-63dabf7b4475.png)
# 
# __When you pick a sensor for your project, there are 2 things the sensor MUST have__:
#   1. __PM 2.5__ measurements
#   2. __Good Historical Values__ for download as a CSV file
# 
# __Write down the country, city, and the street for your sensor.__
# 
# We will use the city name to download weather data for your sensor, and we will store the country and street values in the sensor's feature group.

# ## What makes a good quality Air Quality Sensor?
# 
# In the image below, we can see below that our sensor in Stockholm fulfills our 2 requirements. It has:
#   1. __PM 2.5__ measurements (see upper red-ringed value in image below)
#   2. __Good Historical Measurements__ with few missing values (see lower red-ringed values in image below)

# ## <span style='color:#ff5f27'> üåç STEP 2: Download the Historical Air Quality </span>
# 
# You can download a CSV file containing the historical air quality data from your your sensor's URL.
# Scroll down to the section "Air Quality Historical Data". Click on the PM2.5 option and save the file to the `data` directory in your forked version of this Github repository. Note the name of your CSV file, you will need

# ## <span style='color:#ff5f27'> üåç STEP 3: Get the AQICN_URL and API key. Enter country, city, street names for your Sensor.</span>
# 
# You can find your __AQICN_URL__ if you scroll down the webpage for your sensor - it is the URL inside the redbox here.
# You shouldn't include the last part of the url - "/?token=\__YOUR_TOKEN\__". 
# It is bad practice to save TOKENs (aka API KEYs) in your source code - you might make it public if you check that code into Github!
# We will fill in the token later by saving the AQI_API_KEY as a secret in Hopsworks.

# We will download the historical weather data for your `city` by first extracting the earliest date from your DataFrame containing the historical air quality measurements.
# 
# We will download all daily historical weather data measurements for your `city` from the earliest date in your air quality measurement DataFrame. It doesn't matter if there are missing days of air quality measurements. We can store all of the daily weather measurements, and when we build our training dataset, we will join up the air quality measurements for a given day to its weather features for that day. 
# 
# The weather features we will download are:
# 
#  * `temperature (average over the day)`
#  * `precipitation (the total over the day)`
#  * `wind speed (average over the day)`
#  * `wind direction (the most dominant direction over the day)`

# We define a data validation rule (an expectation in Great Expectations) that ensures that `pm25` values are not negative or above the max value available by the sensor.
# 
# We will attach this expectation to the air quality feature group, so that we validate the `pm25` data every time we write a DataFrame to the feature group. We want to prevent garbage-in, garbage-out.

#  </span> 
# 

# ## <span style="color:#ff5f27;">‚è≠Ô∏è **Exercises:** 
#  </span> 
# 
# Extra Homework:
# 
#   * Try adding a new feature based on a rolling window of 3 days for 'pm25'
#       * This is not easy, as forecasting more than 1 day in the future, you won't have the previous 3 days of pm25 measurements.
#       * df.set_index("date").rolling(3).mean() is only the start....
#   * Parameterize the notebook, so that you can provide the `country`/`street`/`city`/`url`/`csv_file` as parameters. 
#       * Hint: this will also require making the secret name (`SENSOR_LOCATION_JSON`), e.g., add the street name as part of the secret name. Then you have to pass that secret name as a parameter when running the operational feature pipeline and batch inference pipelines.
#       * After you have done this, collect the street/city/url/csv files for all the sensors in your city or region and you make dashboards for all of the air quality sensors in your city/region. You could even then add a dashboard for your city/region, as done [here for Poland](https://github.com/erno98/ID2223).
# 
# Improve this AI System
#   * As of mid 2024, there is no API call available to download historical data from the AQIN website. You could improve this system by writing a PR to download the CSV file using Python Selenium and the URL for the sensor.
